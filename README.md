Snake Game (Python)

Guide the snake around the screen without running into the edges or your own body.
Eat turtles to gain points and extend your snake's length. How high of a score can
you get?

* Uses WASD for controlling the snake.
* Snake will respawn after colliding with the walls or itself. This resets your score.
